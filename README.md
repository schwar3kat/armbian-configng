front-end menu-driven interface for executing various scripts and functions. It tries to simplify the process of creating and managing configuration options. Here's how you can create a new menu entry:

1. **Create a bash script**: This file should contain commands to configure your computer to run.
    - Here's an example of a bash script that you can use as a menu entry:

```bash
# @description Hello World description.
#
# @exitcode 0  If successful.
#
# @options none
function hello::see_world(){

	echo "hello world"
    return 0
}

# @description test description.
#
# @exitcode 0  If successful.
#
# @options none
function tests::see_test(){

	echo "hello world"
    return 0
}
```
Add a description: At the top of your main function in your bash script, add a special comment that starts with # @description. This comment should explain what your script does.

Save your script: Save this file in the lib/configng/$folder/ directory. Replace $folder with the name of the folder where you want to save your script.

Run Jampi-Config: Now, when you run Jampi-Config, it will automatically find your new script and add a new entry to the menu.

# Understanding Folders and Categories: 

In Jampi-Config, folders are used to organize scripts into categories. Each subfolder in the lib/configng/ directory represents a category in the menu. When you select a category, it will open a submenu containing all the scripts in that categoryâ€™s folder. So, make sure to place your script in an appropriate category folder.
